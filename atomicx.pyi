"""
atomicx is an easy-to-use atomics library for Python, providing atomic integer and boolean operations for thread-safe programming.

The package includes two main classes: `AtomicInt` and `AtomicBool`, which allow you to perform atomic operations on shared variables, ensuring thread-safety and preventing race conditions in concurrent programming.

- `AtomicInt` provides atomic operations such as load, store, add, subtract, swap, compare and exchange, multiply, divide, increment, and decrement for integer variables.
- `AtomicBool` provides atomic operations such as load, store, swap, compare and exchange, and flip for boolean variables.

The atomic operations provided by atomicx are implemented using synchronization primitives from the `std::sync::atomic` module in Rust, making them efficient and reliable.
